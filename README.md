# COVIDAPP

Working on an IOS application to model population densities on the UCLA Campus. Popular areas where students congregate around are given annotations and color coded from **Red --> Yellow --> Green** to indicate how many people are in that area and how dense it may be. This project is to help students have a safe return campus during the unprecedented times brought on by COVID-19.
