# COVIDAPP


Working on an IOS application to model population densities on the UCLA Campus. Popular areas where students congregate around are given annotations and color coded from **Red --> Yellow --> Green** to indicate how many people are in that area and how dense it may be. This project is to help students have a safe return campus during the unprecedented times brought on by COVID-19.

_Green_ --> Represents a very low density of people in an area

_Yellow_ --> Represents a moderate density of people in an area

_Red_ --> Represents a high density of people in an area
